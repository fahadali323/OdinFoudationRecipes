        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
        One of my favorite cooking ideas is to deep fat fry 
        our turkey for the holidays or New Yearâ€™s parties. My 
        family loves it when I cook; gives them the time to do
        other baking and cooking while I prepare the main dish.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>7 fluid ounces beer</li>

        <h2>Steps to cook Cajun Fried Turkey</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Melt the butter in a large saucepan over 
                medium heat. Add the onion juice, garlic juice,
                hot sauce, Worcestershire sauce, black pepper, 
                cayenne pepper and beer. Mix until well blended.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a marinade injecting syringe or turkey baster with 
                an injector tip to inject the marinade all over the 
                turkey including the legs, back, wings, thighs and 
                breasts. Place in a large plastic bag and marinate 
                overnight in the refrigerator. Do not use a kitchen 
                trash bag. If your turkey is large, you can use an 
                oven bag.
            </li>
            <li>
                When it's time to fry, measure the amount of oil 
                needed by lowering the turkey into the fryer and
                filling with enough oil to cover it. 
                Remove the turkey and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the oil to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).
                When the oil has come to temperature, lower 
                the turkey into the hot oil slowly using the 
                hanging device that comes with turkey 
                deep-fryers. The turkey should be completely 
                submerged in the oil. Cook for 36 minutes, 
                or 3 minutes per pound of turkey. The turkey
                is done when the temperature in the thickest 
                part of the thigh reaches 180 degrees F. 
                Turn off the flame and slowly remove from the 
                oil, making sure all of the oil drains out of
                the cavity. Allow to rest on a serving
                platter for about 20 minutes before carving.
